# FCC-Product-Landing-Page
This is a product landing page I created for a Free Code Camp Challenge.
I wanted my product landing page to be a lighthearted product that incorporated new technology with pop culture references. 
The design was inspired by the colors of the namesake Pokemon, Tentacool and Tentacruel. 
I used a bold and bright font mixed with an under-water murky depths gradient for ambiance.
